## Working Problem statement

According to Meijer et al., (2021) over 80% of the global annual emissions of plastic in the ocean come from 1000 rivers. Plastic waste has gone from 1.5 million tons in 1950 to 365 million tons in 2020, and is expected to double by 2025 (Alberghini et al., 2023). Alberghini and team suggest that humans ingest a significant amount of microplastics through food, especially fish and other seafood. The effects of these chemicals range from mutating DNA, reproductive harm, cause cancer,  disrupt hormones, and cause harm to organs (Campanale et al., 2020).

The goal of this project is to identify which regions have the highest concentration of microplastics and building a time series model to try to predict plastic concentrations over time, as well as provide target dates with expected plastic concentrations(eg 2025-2030). With this knowledge we can focus clean up efforts within those regions to help reduce these future numbers.
